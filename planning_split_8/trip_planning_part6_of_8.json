Could the workshop or wedding dates be flexible?\n2. **Consider indirect flights:**  Allowing one connecting flight might open up possibilities.\n3. **Prioritize:**  Which event is most important?

Let's break down why:\n\n* **Dubrovnik Constraint:** You must be in Dubrovnik on days 16 and 17. The only direct flight to Dubrovnik is from Zurich.\n* **Zurich Constraint:** You need to be in Zurich for a wedding between days 12 and 16. This means you must fly from Zurich to Dubrovnik on day 16.\n* **Istanbul Constraint:** You want to be in Istanbul between days 9 and 11.\n\n**The Problem:**  There's no way to be in Istanbul (days 9-11), then in Zurich (days 12-16), and then fly to Dubrovnik on day 16. Direct flights don't allow for this sequence.\n\n**Possible Solutions:**\n\n1. **Adjust the Dubrovnik Visit:**  Consider shifting the Dubrovnik visit to earlier in the trip, allowing for a flight from Istanbul to Zurich, then time in Zurich before flying to Dubrovnik.\n2. **Adjust the Istanbul Visit:**  If the Istanbul dates are flexible, move them to after the Zurich wedding. This would allow a flight from Zurich to Dubrovnik, then onward to Istanbul.\n3. **Consider Indirect Flights:** If direct flights are not absolutely essential, you could explore options with connecting flights to make the desired itinerary work.\n\n**Let me know if you'd like to explore any of these solutions by adjusting the constraints.
