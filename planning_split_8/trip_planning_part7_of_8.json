Let's assume you can arrive in Stockholm on Day 1, allowing for the full 5 days (Day 1-5) for the workshop.

Could the visit with relatives in Frankfurt or friends in Hamburg be slightly adjusted? Even a one-day shift could open up possibilities.\n\n2. **Indirect Flights:** If adjusting dates is impossible, consider allowing one indirect flight. This would add travel time but could bridge the gap between Frankfurt and Hamburg.\n\n**Let's assume we can adjust the Hamburg visit to days 12-16.

The only direct flights TO Salzburg are from Hamburg.\n* **Split Constraint:** You MUST be in Split between day 9 and 10. The only direct flights TO Split from cities you could reasonably reach by day 9 are Lyon and Copenhagen.\n* **Lyon Constraint:** You MUST be in Lyon between day 2 and 3. The only direct flight TO Lyon is from Prague.\n\n**The Problem:** To get to Salzburg by day 14, you'd need to be in Hamburg on day 13. To be in Hamburg, you'd likely need to be in Riga or Athens beforehand. This makes it impossible to be in Split on day 9 or 10, as there are no direct flights from those city clusters to Split.\n\n**Possible Solutions:**\n\n1. **Adjust Constraints:** The easiest solution is to relax one or more of the date-specific constraints. Could the friend in Split be met on other days? Could the Salzburg show be attended for a shorter duration?\n2. **Indirect Flights:** Allow for one or two connecting flights. This opens up more possibilities but adds travel time and complexity.\n\n**Without adjustments, a 27-day trip fulfilling all direct flight and date requirements is not possible.** \n\nLet me know if you'd like to explore options with adjusted constraints or indirect flights! \n"}, "trip_planning_example_1333": {"num_cities": "9", "cities": "Stockholm**Amsterdam**Vilnius**Oslo**Budapest**Edinburgh**Stuttgart**Valencia**Lyon", "durations": "4**5**4**5**2**4**3**4**5", "prompt_0shot": "You plan to visit 9 European cities for 28 days in total.
