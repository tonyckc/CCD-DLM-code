Unfortunately, fulfilling all the requirements with the given flight options within the 20-day timeframe is impossible. \n\nLet's break down why:\n\n* **Vienna (5 days, days 1-5):** This locks our starting point.\n* **Prague (5 days, days 5-9):**  This follows Vienna perfectly due to the direct flight connection.\n* **Split (3 days, days 11-13):** We can fly directly from Prague to Split, maintaining the schedule.\n\nNow the problems arise:\n\n* **Riga (2 days, days 15-16):**  There are no direct flights from Split to Riga. To reach Riga by day 15, we'd need to insert other cities with direct connections, consuming valuable time.\n* **Stockholm (2 days, days 16-17):**  This overlaps with the Riga requirement, and while there's a direct flight between them, it doesn't allow for both timeframes to be met.\n\nEven if we try rearranging the order, the lack of direct flights between key cities like Split and Riga, and the overlapping timeframes for Riga and Stockholm, make it impossible to create a 20-day itinerary that satisfies all conditions.\n\n**Possible Solutions:**\n\n1. **Extend the trip:**  A few extra days would provide the flexibility needed to incorporate all cities and meet the time constraints.\n2. **Reconsider direct flights:** Allowing one or two connecting flights could open up more possibilities for routing.\n3. **Adjust timeframes:** If possible, slight adjustments to the fixed dates (like the wedding in Split or the conference in Stockholm) could create more leeway.\n4. **Prioritize cities:**  If flexibility is limited, decide which cities are most important and focus on creating an itinerary around them, potentially dropping some less crucial destinations.\n\nTo provide a helpful solution, I need more information about which of these options is feasible. \n"}, "trip_planning_example_1569": {"num_cities": "10", "cities": "Zurich**Venice**Madrid**Geneva**Dublin**Munich**Krakow**Helsinki**Milan**Seville", "durations": "2**4**2**3**2**3**3**5**3**5", "prompt_0shot": "You plan to visit 10 European cities for 23 days in total.
