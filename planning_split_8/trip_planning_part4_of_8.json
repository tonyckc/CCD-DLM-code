These events overlap, making it impossible to fulfill both obligations with direct flights. \n* **Paris Conference:** You have a conference in Paris on days 13-14, right after the Vilnius show. This means you'd need a direct flight from Vilnius to Paris, which isn't available according to the provided flight information.\n\n**Therefore, it's impossible to create a trip plan that meets all the given constraints using only direct flights.**\n\n**Possible Solutions:**\n\n1. **Adjust the Trip Duration:** Extending the trip by a few days could allow for travel time between conflicting events.\n2. **Consider Indirect Flights:**  Allowing for connecting flights would open up more possibilities for travel between cities.\n3. **Re-evaluate Constraints:**  Determine if any of the time constraints for workshops, shows, or conferences are flexible. Could any dates be shifted?\n4. **Prioritize:** If some events are more important than others, focus on creating a plan that prioritizes those, even if it means missing other events.\n\nLet me know if you'd like to explore any of these solutions.

Let's break down why and see if we can find a workable solution:\n\n**Challenges:**\n\n* **Overlapping Time Constraints:** You have events in Warsaw (Day 1-2) and London (Day 2-3) which are impossible to attend both with direct flights.\n* **Limited Direct Flights:**  While there are many direct flight options, the specific time constraints make it difficult to create a route that satisfies all of them.\n\n**Possible Solutions:**\n\n1. **Adjust Time Constraints:** The most practical solution is to see if any of the time constraints for the events can be adjusted slightly.  Could the workshop in Warsaw be attended on Day 2 only, or could the wedding in London be attended on Day 3 only? Even a small adjustment could open up possibilities.\n\n2. **Consider Indirect Flights:** If adjusting the time constraints isn't possible, you might need to consider a single indirect flight to make the itinerary work. For example, you could fly from Warsaw to a city with a connecting flight to London to attend the wedding.\n\n**Let's assume we can adjust the London wedding to Day 3 only.** Here's a possible itinerary:\n\n**Day 1-2:** Arriving in Warsaw and attend the workshop.\n**Day 2:** Fly from Warsaw to London.\n**Day 3:** Attend the wedding in London.\n**Day 3:** Fly from London to Nice.\n**Day 3-4:** Visit Nice.\n**Day 4:** Fly from Nice to Amsterdam.\n**Day 4-5:** Visit Amsterdam and meet your friend.\n**Day 5:** Fly from Amsterdam to Riga.\n**Day 5-9:** Visit Riga.\n**Day 9:** Fly from Riga to Brussels.\n**Day 9-13:** Visit Brussels.\n\n**Important Note:** This solution relies on the assumption that the London wedding can be attended on Day 3 only.

This is impossible with direct flights as you can't be in two places at once.\n\n**Possible Solutions:**\n\n1. **Adjust the Itinerary:**\n\n   * **Option A:**  Could you shift the London visit to days 3-4? This would allow you to attend the Vienna conference.\n   * **Option B:**  Is it possible to attend only one day of the Vienna conference? This would free up a day for travel.\n   * **Option C:**  Can the Berlin visit be shortened or moved? This might create flexibility.\n\n2. **Consider Indirect Flights:**\n\n   * If adjusting the itinerary isn't possible, you'll need to consider a flight with a layover to get from London to Vienna in time for the conference.\n\n**Let's assume Option A (shifting the London visit) is possible. Here's a potential itinerary:**\n\n**Day 1-4:** Arriving in Hamburg and visit Hamburg for 5 days.\n**Day 4:** Fly from Hamburg to London.\n**Day 4-5:** Visit London for 2 days and attend the show.\n**Day 5:** Fly from London to Vienna.\n**Day 5-8:** Visit Vienna for 3 days and attend the conference.\n**Day 8:** Fly from Vienna to Nice.\n**Day 8-12:** Visit Nice for 5 days.\n**Day 12:** Fly from Nice to Berlin.\n**Day 12-14:** Visit Berlin for 3 days and meet friends.\n**Day 14:** Fly from Berlin to Salzburg.\n**Day 14-15:** Visit Salzburg for 2 days.\n\n**Important Note:** This solution relies on the flexibility to change the London visit.
